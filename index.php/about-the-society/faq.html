                                                <p>No. Even if the Earth was a globe this would be an impossibility. We
                                                    have testimonies from several pilots saying that no curvature can be
                                                    seen at Commercial Airline heights. It has been suggested that
                                                    airplane windows serve to distort the view of passengers and make
                                                    them believe they see curvature when indeed there is none. This was
                                                    likely a ploy by early airline companies to sell more tickets.

                                                    they can’t see the curvature, so the earth must obviously
                                                    be flat! And airline companies probably made the windows distorted
                                                    to see curvature to sell more tickets! This must mean

                                                    was Flat. This was independently conceived much later in the 1800's

                                                <p>No. This is popular theory among some small groups to explain
                                                    gravity, but it is problematic at best. The Earth Is Stationary. We
                                                    are not whizzing about in space at 67,000 miles/hour or at speeds
                                                    accelerating towards the speed of light, because once again, we only
                                                    use science when it works in our favor. Also 67,000 miles/hour is
                                                    much too fast! If we
                                                    actually went at that speed, we would all faint from dizziness!

                                                    number is excessive.</p>

                                                <p>
                                                <p>Actually, it can shown that an infinite plane would be a more stable
                                                    form for gravity to pull things into. As mentioned above though,
                                                    sphere earth gravity is a lie. Many will attempt to say rain drops
                                                    form spheres due to gravity. Of course this is ridiculous - when
                                                    they do form spheres (which is a minority of the time) it is due to
                                                    surface tension.<br><br></p>

                                                    Samuel Shenton and S. Rowbotham, believe there is no end to the
                                                    Earth and that it continues indefinitely. The only edge to the earth
                                                    is the one you are standing on. Some math describing this can be

                                                <p>
                                                <p>This betrays a logical fallacy. Karl Popper relates it like this; you
                                                    may spend your whole life seeing only grey geese. This would lead
                                                    you to assume there were only grey geese. Of course the next day you
                                                    might wake up and see a white goose. Earth, in this analogy, is the
                                                    white goose. <br><br>We are a planet that is infinitely expanding
                                                    but we will accept the concept that other planets could be spheres
                                                    because
                                                    we feel like it. Also, they are above us anyways. Don’t trust
                                                    astronomy always.</p>

                                                <p>
                                                <p>The area where we live on the Flat Earth is encased within a
                                                    <em>Dome</em>, or <em>Firmament</em>. In some texts its also
                                                    referred to as <em>The Vault of Heaven</em>. Found in a very
                                                    surprising amount of religions and societies, the idea can be traced
                                                    to Babylonian, Sumerian, Egyptian, and Christian world-views, and
                                                    likely a great many more. Even some Native American tribes were said
                                                    to see the night sky like a tent. The stars? They were little holes
                                                    poked in the hide of the tent. <br><br>Although we use explanations
                                                    from people that didn’t have the advanced technologies like we do
                                                    today, it is valid to use
                                                    them. We can’t discount the experiences people in the past had
                                                    because we might be being lied to right now.<br><br>As a scientific
                                                    explanation
                                                    it serves very well. It was after all only with Copernicus that we
                                                    started to question the idea of the <em>Firmament</em>. By then we
                                                    already knew quite a bit about calculating and predicting the
                                                    movement of the heavens.
